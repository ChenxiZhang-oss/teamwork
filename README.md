# Our Plan
1. Research Background and Objectives​
Employment and unemployment are core issues affecting social stability and economic development. This study uses data from Baidu Index and Baidu Encyclopedia to identify employment market trends, influencing factors, and potential patterns.​
2. Data Collection​
2.1 Baidu Index​
Select keywords related to "employment" and "unemployment" (e.g., "job hunting", "unemployment rate"). Use Baidu Index’s self-service collection tools to set time (e.g., past 5 years) and regional scopes, then collect search index data.​
2.2 Baidu Encyclopedia​
Use web scraping to target entries like "employment policies" and "unemployment types". Extract key info: policy details, industry employment data, and unemployment causes.​
3. Data Cleaning​
Initial Review: Check data completeness and accuracy.​
Missing Values: Fill with mean/linear interpolation or delete invalid entries.​
Duplicates: Remove repeated records.​
Outliers: Identify and handle via 3σ rule or boxplot analysis.​
Format Conversion: Standardize date and numeric formats.​
4. Descriptive Analysis​
Distribution: Analyze data distribution across regions and time to find central tendencies.​
Correlation: Explore links between employment/unemployment data and economic factors (e.g., GDP).​
Trends: Use time-series analysis to observe changes and predict short-term trends.​
5. Data Visualization​
Tools: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) or BI tools (e.g., FineBI).​
Charts: Line charts for time trends, bar charts for regional comparisons, and scatter plots for correlations.​
6. Conclusions and Outlook​
Summarize key findings to highlight data-driven value for employment research. Propose future directions, such as expanding data sources (e.g., social media posts).​
